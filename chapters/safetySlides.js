        summary: [
            `As an adult, I dated a guy whom I didn’t think was a good fit for me. After telling him several times that I didn’t think we would be a good couple, he refused to accept it. So, I wrote a list of reasons for not wanting to date him. I then gave him a call at work and began citing the list. After going over my list, which was about ten or eleven items, this guy began to go over his list of reasons why we should continue to see each other. Well, as you can imagine, I was at a crossroads. I expected him to argue my list, but I didn’t expect him to have his own list. So, a conversation that should have taken approximately fifteen minutes was well on its way to thirty-five to forty-five minutes. He proceeded to tell me that he “can fix” anything that I had a problem with. Why? Because he saw my list as a communication tool. I was “communicating” what I wanted and needed from him. According to him, he now knew what I wanted and what he needed to change so that he could be who I wanted him to be. As flattering as this may seem, it’s not. I told him he was perfect the way he was, for someone else.`,

            `I don’t care to be with anyone who feels the need to change himself to be who he isn’t. You will learn that we travel through life trying to “find” ourselves, trying to know who we are. And in many instances, some of us will never know. I am not going through my journey to be with someone who knows so little about the importance of being his true self.`,

            `Let me tell you something: If you are with someone who insists on changing to be with you, be wary. Be wary, because at some point, he or she will realize that they are not being true to them, and it may get ugly for you. You don’t want to be blamed for his or her bad decision.`,

            `And if you are with someone who wants you to change yourself to be with him or her, RUN! Run from them as fast as you can, because they are trying to control you.`,

            `You know, I grew up in a home of domestic violence and the worse thing you could ever do is allow yourself to be devalued. We are all human. We are all children of God. And we all deserve to be in happy, healthy, loving relationships. YOU put a value on your life and your body. YOU determine your worth. YOU decide what goes and what doesn’t go in your life.`,

            `You must be careful not to romanticize violence. You can’t view violence as a one-time thing. You can’t believe that “Love conquers all…” Not everything can be fixed. Use the experience as a learning experience and move on.`
