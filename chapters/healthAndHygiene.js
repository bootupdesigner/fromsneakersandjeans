Whether you’re the new girl in school, you just had a birthday or you’re in a new grade. But it’s important that your makeup doesn’t make you look older than you are. At this stage, if your parent or guardian thinks wearing a little makeup is OK, your makeup goal should be simple: to look as fresh and beautiful as you are. And you can get a fresh look by wearing tinted lip gloss and light mascara. If something special is going on, try to add a little bit of eyeshadow and colorful eyeliner. I know you are constantly faced with the images of models, musicians and actors wearing too much and too heavy makeup. But you must remember that they are styled for their job, which is to entertain. If you wear too much makeup or it’s too heavy, you will look older. (And not in the “I look three years older” way—but in the “I look twenty-five years older” way.) Believe me, that’s not the look you’re going for.`

I know, we don’t want to admit it, but when hairs are running rampant on our faces, we must face facts (no pun intended). You may need to get waxed—eyebrows, lips, chin, wherever you need. You should go to the salon to have this done at least once a month, but be sure to have a sensitivity test done on your skin to make sure you’re not allergic to the wax.
