Having sex is a really emotional thing, and having it with the wrong person at the wrong time can disrupt you emotionally. So know that the time will come when you are healthy, happy, and in a loving relationship, but that time is not now. Give your mind and your body space to develop and learn what you really want from that special person.`,

            `Because you are now having a menstrual cycle, you CAN get pregnant—whether you are on or off of your period. A pregnancy occurs because the egg that is released during ovulation has been fertilized by the sperm from a boy’s penis. Again, you CAN get pregnant at any time during the month. The most common time to get pregnant is the five days before your egg is released and the day of release. But because predicting when you ovulate is complicated, it is possible to get pregnant at any time—especially if your period is irregular or you miss it frequently.`,

            `Babies don’t come from a stork; no one drops them off at your door; you don’t go to the hospital and come home with one. If you get pregnant, you must carry that baby in your uterus for forty weeks then deliver it through your vagina. And if this sounds a little scary, that’s because it is. I know you have seen the size of some babies; that big baby came from the very small vaginal canal that you have. This is not a joke, and it’s not a game. Babies are not toys that you can play with today and give to someone else tomorrow. They require feeding, changing, bathing, cooing, playing, teaching, attention, and everything else that you require, times two hundred.`
