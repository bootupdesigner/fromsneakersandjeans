                    `Your self-worth affects every aspect of your life. It determines whether you will lead or follow. Whether you have sex before you want or wait until it’s your time. Whether you will strike out with your own business or continue to work in a job that you hate. Whether you will be content and happy with four excellent friends or “fake” happy with forty. And whether you will be the girl with the guy who treats you better than the lyrics of a great love song or the girl with the guy who calls you a b##ch and hits you.`,

                    `I have been depressed, and it made me forget that I was worthy of everything God had placed on this earth for me. I almost killed myself, but I cried out for God to help me, because I knew that His presence was always there. It was painful. And I hurt. But growth in life comes from pushing through and learning after times of pain and hurt. So don’t give up; don’t give in. Just grit your teeth, hold on and know that you are worthy of life and God’s love.`

This can lead to unrealistic expectations of yourself, or high debt, just to “look” happy. When the world judges you based on your possessions, your self-worth will get you through. Having a strong self-worth is based on who you are, not on what you do for a living or what you have. `,

Destructive criticism is feedback that destroys your self-worth, cuts you down or degrades you. Constructive criticism is feedback that builds you and helps you become a better version of yourself.`,

                    `Constructive criticism may not be what you want to hear, but it is a natural part of personal growth and improvement. We get better by recognizing that we aren’t perfect and that we don’t have all of the answers. Constructive criticism, although you may not always agree with it, helps you know better. Then, you can do better and be better.`
