These images are what breakfast, lunch, family/regular dinner, and formal dinner place settings look like. Before you go out, make a note to review these. Also, many restaurants offer the patrons “finger bowls” to dip their fingers in. Please don’t mistake this finger bowl for a cup of water. It usually comes to the table in a bowl and has  lemon and/or lime slice in it.`]\n            }\n        ],\n        image: Thumbnail,\n        imageAlt: `chapter 4 etiquette`\n    },\n    {\n        id: '6',\n        heading: `Table Settings`,\n        bullets: [\n            {\n                title: `Breakfast`,\n                paragraph: [\n                    `A - Napkin, B - Breakfast plate, C - Cereal bowl, D - Bread and butter plate with knife, E - Cup and saucer spoon, F - Water glass, G - Juice glass, H - Fork,  I - Knife, J - Teaspoon`\n                ],\n                tableSetting: breakfastEtiquette,\n                tableSettingAlt:'breakfast table setting',\n            }\n        ],\n        image: Thumbnail,\n        imageAlt: `chapter 4 etiquette`\n    },\n    {\n        id: '7',\n        bullets: [\n            {\n                title: `Lunch`,\n                paragraph: [\n                    `A - Napkin, B - Lunch plate, C - Soup bowl or first-course plate (salad), D - Bread and butter plate with knife, E - Water glass, F - Beverage glass, G - Fork, H - Knife,  I - Teaspoon, J - Soup spoon`\n                ],\n                tableSetting: lunchEtiquette,\n                tableSettingAlt: `lunch table setting`,\n            }\n        ],\n        image: Thumbnail,\n        imageAlt: `chapter 4 etiquette`\n    },\n    {\n        id: '8',\n        bullets: [\n            {\n                title: `Family Dinner`,\n                paragraph: [\n                    `A - Napkin, B - Dinner plate, C - Salad plate, D - Bread and butter plate with knife, E - Beverage glass, F - Fork, G - Knife, H - Teaspoon`,\n                ],\n                tableSetting: familyEtiquette,\n                tableSettingAlt: `family table setting`,\n            }\n        ],\n        image: Thumbnail,\n        imageAlt: `chapter 4 etiquette`\n    },\n    {\n        id: '9',\n        bullets: [\n            {\n                title: `Formal Dinner`,\n                paragraph: [\n                    `A - Napkin, B - Breakfast plate, C - Soup bowl, D - Bread and butter plate with knife, E - Water glass, F - Beverage glass, G - Beverage glass, H - Salad fork, I - Dinner fork, J - Dessert fork, K - Knife, L - Teaspoon, M - Soup spoon`\n                ],\n                tableSetting: formalEtiquette,\n                tableSettingAlt: `formal table setting`,\n            }\n        ],\n        image: Thumbnail,\n        imageAlt: `chapter 4 etiquette`\n    },\n    {\n        id: '10',\n        quote: [`Things to Remember about Etiquette:`],\n        numberList: [\n            {\n                id: '1',\n                bullet:\n                    [\n                        `“Rudeness is the weak man’s (woman’s) imitation of strength.”-Eric Hoffer`]\n            },\n            {\n                id: '2',\n                bullet:`When entering a room, it is your responsibility to greet those already in the room.`\n            },\n            {\n                id: '3',\n                bullet:`When someone is speaking, do not interrupt or speak over her.
