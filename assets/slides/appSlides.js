                `Did you know the introduction of a book is used to set the tone for the reader? It’s sort of a way for the writer (me) to tell the reader (you) the book’s purpose (goal). When I began writing from sneakers & jeans...the purpose was very clear. To give teen girls...JUST LIKE YOU...the tools and information that’s helped me become happy, healthy, independent, and strong.`,

                `I’m writing this book to tell you that everyone has amazing, great, good, OK, not so good, pretty bad, and very sad things happen. But having a solid sense of who you are, and loving yourself despite your faults and failures, will give you the strength to move forward when the not so good, the pretty bad and the very sad things happen. Throughout my entire life, there have been people (more than I can count, with some family included) who thought I was...AND STILL AM...weird and awkward. And you know what, THAT’S OK. That’s OK, because I’m SPLENDID. And splendid people are innovators; while ordinary people are followers. I believe in being true to who I am. And for me, that means doing what feels natural; standing on the side of what is right; and treating others the way I want to be treated. I don’t think I have ever made a decision, of any kind, because it was “popular” or “hot.” I KNOW ME. I AM HAPPY WITH ME. And I DON’T COMPROMISE MY CHARACTER FOR ANY REASON or ANYONE.`,

                `I am fortunate to have a mother that worked very hard to teach me the importance of being a woman amongst women. Which for me is: A woman who can think for herself. A woman who can learn from her mistakes. A woman who can believe in herself, when no one else does. A woman who is strong in spirit, when her body is weak. A woman who knows, that where you are today, doesn’t mean that’s where you’ll be tomorrow.`,

                `My hope is that from sneakers & jeans...will give you what you need to become a woman amongst women. So to start you off in the right direction,  I offer to you this very powerful quote:`

Mainly, women who wear the wrong bra have poor posture because of it.`,
                        `Finding a bra that is the right fit and size for you may seem like a challenge, but it’s not.`,
                        `Bra sizes are determined by your chest size and your cup size. Your chest size (or band) is the part of the bra that runs across your chest and back, and is written in number form on the bra (32, 34, 36, 38, and so on). Your cups are the round parts of the bra that hold your breasts in place and are written in alphabet form on the bra (AA, A, B, C, D, DD, and so on). Because there are many combinations of chest and cup sizes, it is important to have your measurements done by a professional. Feel free to stop in any department store that sells women’s lingerie for a bra fitting. I have had many fittings done over the years, and they have been free. I recommend that you go into a department store, and have a bra fitting done by one of the associates to find out what size you are.`,

These come in the same size measurements as your regular bra. And lastly, make a mental note of the fabrics that you find comfortable to wear, because different materials can irritate your skin.`

This is known as date rape—when forced sex occurs between two people who already know each other. Even if you have already agreed to and had sex with a person before, he or she doesn’t have the right to force you to have sex.`,

            summary: [
                `As an adult, I dated a guy whom I didn’t think was a good fit for me. After telling him several times that I didn’t think we would be a good couple, he refused to accept it. So, I wrote a list of reasons for not wanting to date him. I then gave him a call at work and began citing the list. After going over my list, which was about ten or eleven items, this guy began to go over his list of reasons why we should continue to see each other. Well, as you can imagine, I was at a crossroads. I expected him to argue my list, but I didn’t expect him to have his own list. So, a conversation that should have taken approximately fifteen minutes was well on its way to thirty-five to forty-five minutes. He proceeded to tell me that he “can fix” anything that I had a problem with. Why? Because he saw my list as a communication tool. I was “communicating” what I wanted and needed from him. According to him, he now knew what I wanted and what he needed to change so that he could be who I wanted him to be. As flattering as this may seem, it’s not. I told him he was perfect the way he was, for someone else.`,

                `I don’t care to be with anyone who feels the need to change himself to be who he isn’t. You will learn that we travel through life trying to “find” ourselves, trying to know who we are. And in many instances, some of us will never know. I am not going through my journey to be with someone who knows so little about the importance of being his true self.`,

                `Let me tell you something: If you are with someone who insists on changing to be with you, be wary. Be wary, because at some point, he or she will realize that they are not being true to them, and it may get ugly for you. You don’t want to be blamed for his or her bad decision.`,

                `And if you are with someone who wants you to change yourself to be with him or her, RUN! Run from them as fast as you can, because they are trying to control you.`,

                `You know, I grew up in a home of domestic violence and the worse thing you could ever do is allow yourself to be devalued. We are all human. We are all children of God. And we all deserve to be in happy, healthy, loving relationships. YOU put a value on your life and your body. YOU determine your worth. YOU decide what goes and what doesn’t go in your life.`,

                `You must be careful not to romanticize violence. You can’t view violence as a one-time thing. You can’t believe that “Love conquers all…” Not everything can be fixed. Use the experience as a learning experience and move on.`
